# GoF Definition

Define a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Concept

A client can select an algorithm from a set of algorithms dynamically at runtime. An object can have states an behaviors, and some of these behaviors may vary among the objects of a class. This pattern focuses on the changing behaviors that can be associated with an object at a specific time.
