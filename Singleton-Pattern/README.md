# GoF Definition

Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

## Concept

The Singleton pattern restricts the use of `new` and ensures that you do not have more than one instance of the class.
This pattern says that a class should have only one instance. You can create an instance if it is not available; otherwise you should use an existing instance to serve your needs.
