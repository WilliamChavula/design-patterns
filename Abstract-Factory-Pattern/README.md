# GoF Definition
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. 

## Concept
An abstract factory is often referred to as a *factory of factories*. This pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme. In this process, you do not instantiate a class directly; instead, you instantiate a concrete factory and, after that, create products using the factory.
