The Simple Factory pattern creates an object without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.

## Concept

In _OOP_, a factory is such an object that can create other objects. A factory can be invoked in many ways, but most often, it uses a method that can return objects with varying prototypes.
Any subroutine that helps create these new objects is considered a factory. Most importantly, it helps to abstract the process of object creation frmo the consumers of the application.
